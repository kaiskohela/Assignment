# Assignment
A simple solution for the assignment 


The proposed solution is implemented using java.

The main program reads the file path introduced by the user via the console,
then we iterate over the lines of the input file containing the capacity of the package followed by couples of items in this format:

capacity : (number, weight, cost in â‚¬) 


the final output gives the list of items that can be picked into the package with maximum cost and minimum weight as possible.
